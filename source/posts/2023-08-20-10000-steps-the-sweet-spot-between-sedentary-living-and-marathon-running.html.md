A few weeks ago, wandering through the ancient lanes of Rome, we found ourselves in
a suprising experiment. In the backdrop of the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the 
Spanish steps, our phones tracked un unexpected 20,000 to 30,000 thousand steps per
day. It wasn't just the Roman legacy and innovation struck a chord, but also the 
increased wellbeing after the walks. It become clear that walking such distances was
doing more than just taking us one historical site to another; it was impactict the
clarity of my thoughts, reliving anxiety and uplifting my overalll mood.

When we arrived back in Novi Sad, we knew that we want to keep reaping the benefits
of this newfound routine. In this essay, I'll unravel the history of the popular 
10,000 steps plan, the health benefits, the corelations between all-cause mortality
and daily activity in individuals, and the practicalities of implementing such a 
routine into our busy everyday lives.
