Innovation isn't just about creating cutting-edge technology, it is also about
reinventing the ways we interact with out environment, nature, and how we expand
our empathy not only to other humans, but also the animals that share this planet
with us. This includes the causes we stand for, the food and water that we
consume, the clothes that we weat, and the product and brands that we support.

This is exactly what my wife and I have done: we've innovated our diet, swithing
to partial of full vegeterianism. The reason why I'm saying partial, and not full
vegeterianism will be explored futher down in the article.

## War, animal slaughter, and the first emergence of my vegeterian conviction

Growing up in the war-torn Yugoslavia, I've experienced the second-hand hardships
of everyday survival from my very early childhood. Second-hand in a sense that
the true, firts-hand, hardships were experienced by my parents.

Just as I was three years old, one of the worlds largest inflation rates hit our
country. 116,545,906,563,330 percent to be exact. To put it in real, humanly
understandable numbers, if you had the equivalent of 1 million dollars in Yugoslavian
dinars, by the end of the year, you would have the equivalent purchasing power of
$0.0000008 dollars. Yes, that is going from being a milionare to having nothing.

In such economic situation, the shelves in the stores are empty, because neither you
nor the store owner is able to collect enough capital to purchase goods. Life becomes
chaotic.

My family was lucky enough to live in a small city, where returning to an agrecultural
way of life was realistic and achivable. We used the small land that we have in the
garden to plant potatos, tomatos, peppers, and cabbages. While the back of our garden was
converted to a place where we can keep animals. Chickens, rabbits, and a couple of pigs.
Our home become a mini farm, in the middle of a small city. This transformation was
necessary and a godsent oportunity for our family. We were not starving.

We lived on this mini farm for the next ten years, from my 3rd year, to my early teenager
years where the economic situation improved. I tresure this part of my life, as it thought
me to have a deeper respect for nature and animals than I would if I would grow up in
the city sheltered from the realities of where our food comes from. The experience
connected me with the land, made me understand and appriciate the cycle of life.
It cultivated a deep respect for the animals we shared our space with, and whom we
ultimately had to kill in order to have enough food on the table.

One thing I was never trully able to except was the killing and the slaughtering part.
One day I was chasing a chicken out in the garden, the next day, I was helping my mother
chop off its had, collect and drip out the blood, pull out his legs, and take of its
skin. I did it, countlessly many times, I even liked the taste of the chicken and the
rabbits that we slaughtered. I know what I was doing was wrong, but at the same time,
I know that I had to do it.

No one was vegeterian back than, neither was such an option discussed.

## Ethics of factory farming

For many, the decision to go vegeterian is driven by ethical concerns surrounding
animal walfare. Numerous investigations and studies have documented the often cruel
conditions in factory farms, where the majority of meat is produced. Animals are
often subjected to extreme confinment, phycal pain, limited mobility, and violent
treatment. A vegeterian diet, helps to reduce the demand for animal-based products,
therefore reducing the support for such inhumane practices.

We are aware that the impact of an individual, or in our case, a married couple is
relatively small in the grand scheme of things. However, if history has taught us
anything, it's that change oftern begins with individual actions that inspire others
to do the same. By following a vegeterian diet, we aim to set a positive
example, inspiring our frieds, collegues, and anyone else who is open to hear
our story.

The ripple effects of such decisions should not be underestimated. The more people
who adopt a vegiterian diet, even partially, the greater the the reduction in the demand
for animale-based products.
