Innovation isn't just about creating cutting-edge technology, it is also about
reinventing the ways we interact with out environment, nature, and how we expand
our empathy not only to other humans, but also the animals that share this planet
with us. This includes the causes we stand for, the food and water that we
consume, the clothes that we weat, and the product and brands that we support.

This is exactly what my wife and I have done: we've innovated our diet, swithing
to partial of full vegeterianism. The reason why I'm saying partial, and not full
vegeterianism will be explored futher down in the article.

## War, animal slaughter, and the first emergence of my vegeterian conviction

Growing up in the war-torn Yugoslavia, I've experienced the second-hand hardships
of everyday survival from my very early childhood. Second-hand in a sense that
the true, firts-hand, hardships were experienced by my parents.

Just as I was three years old, one of the worlds largest inflation rates hit our
country. 116,545,906,563,330 percent to be exact. To put it in real, humanly
understandable numbers, if you had the equivalent of 1 million dollars in Yugoslavian
dinars, by the end of the year, you would have the equivalent purchasing power of
$0.0000008 dollars. Yes, that is going from being a milionare to having nothing.

In such economic situation, the shelves in the stores are empty, because neither you
nor the store owner is able to collect enough capital to purchase goods. Life becomes
chaotic.

My family was lucky enough to live in a small city, where returning to an agrecultural
way of life was realistic and achivable. We used the small land that we have in the
garden to plant potatos, tomatos, peppers, and cabbages. While the back of our garden was
converted to a place where we can keep animals. Chickens, rabbits, and a couple of pigs.
Our home become a mini farm, in the middle of a small city. This transformation was
necessary and a godsent oportunity for our family. We were not starving.

We lived on this mini farm for the next ten years, from my 3rd year, to my early teenager
years where the economic situation improved. I tresure this part of my life, as it thought
me to have a deeper respect for nature and animals than I would if I would grow up in
the city sheltered from the realities of where our food comes from. The experience
connected me with the land, made me understand and appriciate the cycle of life.
It cultivated a deep respect for the animals we shared our space with, and whom we
ultimately had to kill in order to have enough food on the table.

One thing I was never trully able to except was the killing and the slaughtering part.
One day I was chasing a chicken out in the garden, the next day, I was helping my mother
to chop off its had, collect and drip out the blood, pull out his legs, and take off its
skin. I did it, countlessly many times, I even liked the taste of the chicken and the
rabbits that we slaughtered. I know what I was doing was wrong, but at the same time,
I know that I had to do it.

No one was vegeterian back than, neither was such an option discussed.

## My first encounter with vegeterianism though Lisa Simpson

My first meaningfull encounter with vegeterianism came from an unexpected source:
through the character of Lisa Simpson from the animated series The Simpsons. In this
episode, titled "Lisa the Vegeterian", Lisa makes the decision to stop eating meat
after she forms a bond with a lamb at a petting zoo.

This episode strongly resonated with me in my early teenage years. I felt the exact
same hard to describe feeling of knowing what you and your cultere are doing is not
ethically sound, but at the same time knowing that I am also just a product of my
culture and environment, and that changing or defending such a choice would be an
uphill battle with my friends, family, and the wider comunity.

This was the seed where my vegeterian yourney begin. I become concious of my everyday
choices, and fully aware that something had to die for me to have a dinner.

In real life, outside of television, I still didn't know anyone who was a vegeterian.
I only know peole who ridiculed them, or who spread various missconceptions about
lack of proper and adequate nutrition. Growing up in this culture, I too completly
accepted the fact that vegeterianism is a choice for the fringe of the society who
are sacrifing their personal health for the benefit of animals. I might also
contributed and spread this information furhter. My sources? My grandma told me.

## Ethics of factory farming

For many, the reality of how we kill animals to create products is a known fact,
but they are too far detached from the actual place where we are processing animals.
From my 15th birthday, this is same situation for me as well. I'm no longer part of
the process, I'm just a consumer visiting a grocery shop, aware of what is going on,
but emotially and ethically disconnected from the process.

However, the reality of factory farming is even worse than what we did to them on
our small farms. There is no place for them to have a meaningfull life, to see the
sun, or to smell the grass. They are born slaves, and they killed even before they
realize what is going on. Animals are ofter confined to limited space, subjected to
extreme pain and anxiety, fed above their limits, and then sloughtered even before
they reach adalthood.

This detachment is a big problem. Most people would never be able to make the choice
to directly hard to an animal, directly with their own hand. But, when I hold a sausage
in my local grocery shop, it is hard to connect what needed to happen in order for me
to have a conviniently packaged piece of meal.

The problem of factory farms was only put to the forefront of my thoughts in my early
twenties. I joined a martial arts club, and this was probably the first time that I
encountered a larger number of vegeterians in one place. They were not the pushy kind,
I didn't even realize that they didn't eat meat until I started visiting multiday
seminars with them, where we would use the evenings to go out and eat at local
restaurants. As I bonded with them, I explored and probed them with mutliple questions
about their diet choices, nutrition, and the reasons they choose this lifestyle.
They had a profound impact on me which led me to introspect my personal choices in life.

A vegeterian diet, helps to reduce the demand for animal-based products, therefore
reducing the support for such inhumane practices.

We are aware that the impact of an individual, or in our case, a married couple is
relatively small in the grand scheme of things. However, if history has taught us
anything, it's that change oftern begins with individual actions that inspire others
to do the same. By following a vegeterian diet, we aim to set a positive
example, inspiring our frieds, collegues, and anyone else who is open to hear
our story.

The ripple effects of such decisions should not be underestimated. The more people
who adopt a vegiterian diet, even partially, the greater the the reduction in the demand
for animale-based products.

## Mostly Vegeterians for more than a year

I was personally an on-and-off vegeterian in the last ten years. I had years where I
didn't even touch any meat, and years where I was consuming meat on a regular basis.
However, to achive consistency, it took a push from my wife to make a switch. We both
switched at one point last May, practically overnight.

Some people describe the transition as a hard process with multiple compromises. However,
for us it was effortless, we just stopped consuming meat, and never really looked back.

Now, there are multiple asterisks attached to the previous statements.

When it comes to diet, my wife is a complete vegeterian. I rarelly or never see her consume
any meat based products. On the other side, I do still eat fish, and I do have a couple
of occasions over the year that I consume meat, but these are the exceptions not the rule.

The reason for this is mostly pragmaticall. Our culture is far from being vegeterian friendly,
and our choices are frequently limited in local stores. The combination of it beign easy
to make, cheap to buy, and having good taste, is not always an existing choice that we can
make. Lidl, is our best friend in this regard. It is one of the few stores that has regular
supply of vegeterian food that fits all the above categories.

## From Vegetarianism to Whole Foods Plant-Based Lifestyle

Despite having transitioned to a vegeterian diet, out journey towards optimal health is
still very much a work in progress. Out current diet, while meat-free, heavily relies on
processed foodsa, a variety of bakery goods, sweets and lots of sugar. While these items
are vegeterian, many of them are high in saturad fats, sugars, preservatives and other
substances that are known to have an adverse effect on health if consumed in excess.

One particular study has shaped our perspective. It is the then groundbraking study led by
Ancel Keys involving seven countries, and around 13,000 middle aged man in Japan, Italy,
Greece, Netherlands, Finland, United States, and Yugoslavia.

Keys and his colegues discovered that individuals from Mediterranean regions, who adhered
to a diet high in fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, olive oil, and minimal consumption
of red meat or processed foods, shoved significantly lowers levels of heart desise compared
to their counterparts following a typical diet filled with meat and processed foods. This
is a compeling study to me, particularly given the prevailing heart-releated health concerns
within my family.

Further research indicates that a plant-based diet, expecially one low in processed foods
and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can potentially delay the onset or
decelarate the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This discovery holds significant implications
for my wife, considering the presence of Alzheimer's occurance within her family.

Therefore, we are making a commited effort to not only adhere to a vegeterian diet but to
gradually shift towards a more whole food, plant based diet. This dies emphesises the consumption
of foods in their natural, least processed form, and minimizes the intake of oils, sugars, and
artificial additives.

By taking this step, we aim to significantly lower our risk of heart disease
and Alzheimer's, while benefiting from an overall improvement in our health and
wellbeing. The connection between diet and health has never been clearer to us,
and we're excited to continue on this path of nutritional enlightenment.

For those of you considering a shift in your diet toward a more vegetable based one:
you need to know that the first step is the hardest after which the change becomes easier
as you learn about the alternatives and as you learn how to deal with the social pressure
about following a non-traditional diet.

Stay tuned,<br>
