        <p>Greeting all passionate minds out there!</p>

<p>We are Daniela and Igor, a recently married couple with a shared passion
for learning, deep conversations, and a never ending voyage for understanding
the world around us.</p>

<p>We would like to invite you into our collaborative venture — a start-up
of us, if you will. It's not a traditional start-up, there are no business
plans, no revenue, and definitely no spreadsheets. Our product is a collection
of our thoughts, the extension of our dining room, an open invite in our late
night discussion, and exploration of various topics that shape our everyday
lives.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-doing-this">Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>The idea sparked when we realized the countless hours we were spending consuming
and discussion information. We are growing, yes, but the growth is untested and
unchallenged by external parties. What we learn could be worth gold, or it can
be the contrary, an amplification of our bubble, a local maxima of ideas.</p>

<p>With this blog, we are opening up our thoughts and emotions, and inviting you to
critique, support and to judge us. We want not only to learn, but to share what we
learned. To inspire and influence, to build a community, and to leave a legacy.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-want-to-achieve">What do we want to achieve?</h2>

<p>As we launch this blog, I keep in mind the words of Carl Sagan: "We can judge
our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers". Out
mission, therefore, is not only to start a blog, but to be courageous and question
what needs to be questioned and to answer what needs to be answered.</p>

<p>What we want is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To be smarter and more informed</strong>: By sharing content, we articulate our thoughts which
helps us to understand ourselves better and to get feedback about blindsides and
sharpen our thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To share our support</strong>: We are passionate about various socio-economic topics. By
putting our words out, we have the potential to inspire and influence, and maybe even
bring on a change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To snapshot our growth</strong>: Our creations are a part of us that we leave behind, a record
of our journey, our struggles, and growth over time. My hope is that our children, or
grandchildren, can access it and get inspired by our journey.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>

<p>We invite you to join us on this venture. Be part of the conversation. Share your
insights, question our ideas, propose new topics, challenge our views.</p>

<p>Stay tuned,<br />
Daniela and Igor</p>
